# Nitro tRPC Starter

Welcome to the **Nitro tRPC Starter** repository! This project provides a boilerplate to help you kickstart a full-stack application using [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) with [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/). 

## Features

- **Type Safety**: Full-stack type safety enabled by tRPC.
- **API Routes**: Effortless creation of serverless functions using Nitro.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for building scalable and performant applications.
- **Developer Experience**: Pre-configured with best practices and tools for a great developer experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= 18.x)
- pnpm (>=9)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fisand/nitro-trpc-starter.git
cd nitro-trpc-starter
pnpm install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command will start a local development server with hot-reloading.
